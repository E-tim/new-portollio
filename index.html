                <P>
                    A front-end developer that uses React, Javascript, APIs, CSS, Bootstrap to make beautiful website and app .
                    I focus only on front-end for now , and if there's need to make a project that involve using 
                    backend, I use firebase . I make my own mini backend to store API keys before I deploy my app.
                    The more I learn , the more I realise there's more to learn to solve problems and make efficient
                    app for bussiness , individual , and the world to enjoy the latest technology .

            <h2>HEALTH TIPS</h2>
            <P>I used to eat whatever I want to eat and drink alcohol , I don't care if they are good for my
               health or not. I wouldn't go to gym , I ate late at night , sometimes wokeup in the middle of night
               just to have some bread or chocolate . One thing I noticed , I was always sick . I would go
               to hospital complaining . Dr , in the hospital never asked me about what I eat or if I am 
               living a healthy life style . It was always about writing script to get expensive pain-killer
               and some anti-inflammatory medications at their
               pharmacy .
            </P>
            <p>
                My life changed when I came accros AMERIX on twitter , He changed my life and I am sure alot of men 
                out there too . I learnt from him you can't just eat anything because they are sweet , you ask yourself
                is this good for me , what are the side effect of eating this or drinking alcohol. I think first thing to
                healthy life is to know what you are putting in your mouth if it is good for you or not .
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Let us quickly talk about four(4) important topic here.  To know more about health , I will
                suggest you follow him on twitter <span style="color: green;">@amerix</span>
            </p>
            <p>1. Food</p>
            <p>2. Fasting</p>
            <p>3. Gym (body)</p>
            <p>4. 4Bs</p>

            <p>1. Food : Before you eat anything , ask yourself is this good for me . The sugar , sodas, juice,
                energy drinks, alcohol and all different types of junk foods. If I take this , won't this lead to obesity, chronic inflamation & metabolic
                syndrome (hypertension, & diabetes) . You will pick the best engine oil for your car , why can't you select
                a healthy food and drink.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                2. Fasting : When we fast , fats store in the liver is converted to energy for body and brain to use . 
                Research shows that we burning fat to survive . It is good to fast daily . When I started it was hard
                because I like eating atleast three times a day , breakfast, lunch and dinner with some snacks in between.
                With time and consistency I fast daily . Take your time and watch the video below to see why fasting is good for you. 
            </p>

                </video>
            </div>
            <p>
                3. Gym : The benefits of lifting weights include building muscle, burning body fat, strengthening your
                bones and joints, reducing injury risk, and improving heart health -source(google). Lifting heavy weight and and do some
                exercise is the best way to start my day . I used to carry 20kg and do 15 decline and incline push-up .
                That's too low , right ? yes I know that . right now, I lift 55kg and more and i do 40 push in 10 set.
                I see how that have made my bone strong and I like the shape of my body . Starting my day this way gives me confidence ,
                 and now, it's part of me and i can't do without it.
